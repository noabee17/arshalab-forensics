    program_execution:
      description: "Determining what programs were run and when"
      primary_artifacts:
        - prefetch
      supporting_artifacts:
        - registry_run_keys
      typical_questions:
        - "what programs ran"
        - "what was executed"
        - "program execution"
        - "applications run"
      analysis_approach: |
        1. Start with Prefetch for recent executions
        2. Check Registry Run keys for startup programs
        3. Look for anomalies: first-time executions, suspicious paths
    
    web_activity:
      description: "User's web browsing behavior"
      primary_artifacts:
        - browser_history
      supporting_artifacts: []
      typical_questions:
        - "websites visited"
        - "browsing history"
        - "what did user search"
        - "downloads"
      analysis_approach: |
        1. Extract browser history (Chrome, Edge)
        2. Identify suspicious domains
        3. Check for download activity
    
    timeline_reconstruction:
      description: "Chronological sequence of all user activity"
      primary_artifacts:
        - prefetch
        - browser_history
        - registry_run_keys
      supporting_artifacts: []
      typical_questions:
        - "what happened"
        - "timeline"
        - "sequence of events"
        - "activity on date"
      analysis_approach: |
        1. Collect all available artifacts
        2. Sort chronologically
        3. Identify activity clusters and gaps
